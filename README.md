## :dart: Description ##

This project was made during week 8 of MIT xPRO bootcamp, the original asignment was two eyes that follow the mouse pointer as much as you move it. 
Based on the initial project I have created my own version using The Simpson theme, you will move the eyes in Homero, March, Lisa and Bart.
